# Orbital Rings
## Space Within Reach

This book is an attempt to realistically approach orbital ring systems. To do that, there are four sections:

1. What are orbital rings? Why do we want them?
2. What are the technical challenges? How do we solve them?
3. How do we build and grow the orbital ring system?
4. What are the legal, political, and economic challenges and how do we approach them?
