    "# Solar Power\n",
    "\n",
    "In [What Are Orbital Rings?](what-are-orbital-rings.html) we briefly talked about the possibility for orbital rings to provide extremely cost-effective solar power, but not how or why. Let's dive into that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terrestrial vs Space-Based Solar\n",
    "\n",
    "Terrestrial solar has the advantage of being, well, on the ground; we don't need to send the panels into space, which is extremely expensive right now. However, it has a few serious disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- About 30% of solar radiation reflects off the atmosphere, and another 23% is absorbed before it hits the ground. That means only about 47% of the sun's light actually reaches the surface. (XXX Cite: https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/definitions/how-is-solar-power-generated#:~:text=About%2030%20percent%20of%20incoming,atmospheric%20particles%2C%20dust%20and%20ozone.)\n",
    "- Weather causes a drastic impact on its efficiency, causing 30-50% reductions due to cloud coverage and 10-20% in heavy rain. (XXX: Add citation)\n",
    "- Weather also necessitates more durable panels, which increases their weight and cost (due to additional thickness of the glass layer) (XXX: Add citation)\n",
    "- Solar irradiance is highly dependent on latitude, with the highest intensity at the equator and falling off as you get closer to the poles (XXX: Add citation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Space-based solar has none of these problems, though it does carry a few notable ones of its own:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's currently very expensive to send mass quantities of solar panels into space, and getting the energy back down to Earth is both difficult and inefficient (XXX: Add citation)\n",
    "- Panels in normal Earth orbits experience drastic temperature swings many times per day, which impact both the durability and effiency (XXX: Add citation)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, neither of these problems are inherent to space-based solar, just the implementations we have at hand right now. Let's talk about how orbital rings can solve both of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solar On Orbital Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "Orbital rings provide a unique set of solutions to this problem. Getting the solar panels up there is as easy as taking an electric lift from the ground up to space, and they only experience the temperature swing once a day. Since solar panels are more efficient when they're colder (XXX: Add citation), we *could* build a system to distribute heat from the hot side to the cold side, evening it out over the course of a day; however, we'll keep that out of scope for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of (the bulk of) Earth's atmosphere, the solar irradiance is about $1,360 W/m^2$. That means every square meter of Earth's atmosphere receives 1360 watts of energy from the sun. We can't capture all of that, but with high-efficiency panels, we can capture about 30%. That means a 1 square meter solar panel on an orbital ring, pointed straight at the sun, would produce 408 watts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine we have solar panels all the way around an orbital ring. How many of those are pointed straight at the sun, receiving the full irradiance? Well, we know that half of them are going to be on the other side of the Earth, so we immediately cut our power per square meter in half. But we also need to account for the ones that are on the sun-facing side, but angled away.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive widget, you can play around with a simple model and see what percentage of light is being converted on average by each panel."
